- 30 levels across 6 worlds
- Translations, reflections, and rotations
- Par move system with star ratings
- Ghost trail on undo
- Out-of-bounds detection with move penalty
- Challenge mode (timed, unlocks after completing all levels)

**Worlds:**
1. Translations
2. Reflections  
3. Rotations
4. Mixed Transformations
5. Combined Transformations
6. Master Challenge

**IB Topics Covered:**
- Translation vectors
- Reflection across x = k, y = k, y = x, y = -x
- Rotation about the origin and arbitrary points (90°, 180°, 270°)
- Combining transformations

## 🚀 Running Locally

No build process needed — this is pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jakmann86/mathsgames.git
cd mathsgames

# Serve with any static file server
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server 5501
```

Then open `http://localhost:5501` in your browser.

## 🌐 Deployment

This site is hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

To deploy updates:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "describe your change"
git push
```

GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds within ~60 seconds of a push.

**Settings:** Repo → Settings → Pages → Branch: `main` → Root `/`

---

## ➕ Adding a New Game

1. Create a new folder: `mkdir new-game-name`
2. Build your game inside it with its own `index.html`
3. Add a new cabinet card to the root `index.html` (copy an existing cabinet block and update the content)
4. Push to GitHub — it's live

Each game's shareable URL will be:
```
https://jakmann86.github.io/mathsgames/new-game-name
```

## 🏫 Teaching Philosophy

These tools are built around a few principles:

- **Active over passive** — students build and solve from the start
- **Conceptual before procedural** — understanding *why* before mastering *how*  
- **Puzzles over problems** — multiple valid approaches, productive struggle
- **Place-based** — designed for an IB context in Buenos Aires
